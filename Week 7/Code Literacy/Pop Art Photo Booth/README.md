I took the Computer Vision code for Photo Booth and wanted to play around with it and have it do more.  I added some text that flashes 'NO CODE NO PAIN' while the photo booth changed colors randomly. I did this by inputting a text command and setting the middle text to random.  The photos I inputted a tint(random(255),random(255),random(255)) command so the photos alternate repeatedly in different colors.
